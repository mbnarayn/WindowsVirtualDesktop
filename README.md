# Windows Virtual Desktop

The high level components that make up Windows Virtual Desktop are a Tenant Group, Tenant, Host Pool and App Groups.

- Tenant Group - When you create a tenant in Windows Virtual Desktop it is associated by default to a Tenant Group called "Default Tenant Group". While the New-RdsTenantGroup PowerShell cmdlet appears to make it possible to create multiple Tenant Groups, there is no documentation or use cases available from Microsoft regarding the creation of multiple tenant groups so it is better to leave this as is for now and operate from the Default Tenant Group. Management access and end user permissions can be configured via controls available at the Tenant and Application Group levels.

- Tenant - Creating a tenant in Windows Virtual Desktop is the first step toward building your desktop virtualization solution. A tenant is a group of one or more host pools. With a tenant, you can build out host pools, create app groups, assign users, and make connections through the service. 

- Host Pool - Host pools are a collection of one or more identical virtual machines running as session hosts in Azure and registered to a Windows Virtual Desktop tenant. Each host pool will contain an app group that end users can interact with.  

- App Groups - Each host pool consists of one or more app groups that are used to publish remote desktop and remote application resources to users. The default app group "Desktop Application Group" created for a new Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD) Host Pool provides the full desktop experience. In addition, you can create one or more RemoteApp application groups for the host pool to provide an app only experience without overwhelming the user with a full blown desktop experience. 

## Windows Virtual Desktop Load Balancing

Windows Virtual Desktop host pools can deployed in one of two different modes, Pooled or Persistent (also known as Personal).

With a 'Pooled' host pool users are directed to the best available session host in the pool and to utilize shared multi-session virtual machines. With a 'Persistent' host pool users have their own virtual machine always have a 1:1 mapping to a session host within the host pool.

Host Pools in 'Pooled' mode supports two load-balancing methods. Each method determines which session host will host a userâ€™s session when they connect to a resource in a host pool.

Breadth-first load balancing allows you to evenly distribute user sessions across the session hosts in a host pool.

Depth-first load balancing allows you to saturate a session host with user sessions in a host pool. Once the first session reaches its session limit threshold, the load balancer directs any new user connections to the next session host in the host pool until it reaches its limit, and so on.
